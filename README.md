👋 Hi, I’m @Deku-2k <br><br>

👀 I’m interested in IT administration, server management, and automation. Currently, I'm focused on becoming a DevOps engineer and improving my skills in cloud technologies, continuous integration, and deployment. <br><br>

🌱 I’m currently learning DevOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes). I’m also exploring Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform and Ansible. <br><br>

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to system automation, DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and infrastructure management. I’m particularly interested in working with teams or individuals who can guide me on my journey to becoming a DevOps professional. <br><br>

📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via GitHub Issues or at my email: az-800cert@outlook.com <br><br>

⚡ Fun fact: I have been managing Windows hybrid servers for several years and am passionate about automating server management to improve efficiency and scalability. <br><br>
